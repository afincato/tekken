Example

```
## general

- [x] test d(t)
- [w] toast

## ahah

- [x] make nothing d(20082017)
- [ ] nah s(20082017)
- [c] ehh
```

## Why

Taking as much as we can from stuff like [org-mode](https://orgmode.org), and put it into a web interface. Keep using simple text files with a markdown syntax (extended), where you can mix notes and tasks and anything, then have a proper view to filter out tasks from notes etc. No need to switch to emacs, no fear to have your data locked-in in some application.

Using [dat](https://datproject.org) to collaborate on those text files (soon).
 
## Portability

With plain text files you can do any kind of text-manipulation, eg:

- copy a list or a bunch of newlines from an email and format each new line / list-item as task-list-item w/ a shortcut
- copy from `project.todo` and paste it somewhere, share it, send a message, etc.
- print it out on a piece of paper (stupid but useful)
- convert it back and forth from / to different format by implementing an AST
